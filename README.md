Attributes are properties we give our objects.
 
Just like every person can have a name,
a height, an address, etc, we can model
characteristics of an object by giving it
attributes.
 
Every attribute is stored in an instance variable.
 
An object's instance variables are its attributes,
the things that distinguish it from other objects
of the same class.
 
reload (exit/restart) for all your examples.

```ruby 
class Person
 
  def name=(str)
    @name = str
  end
 
end
```
 
Attributes are just implemented via methods in ruby.
The name= method accepts one argument, a string,
that is the name of the individual.
 
Each instance or individual person gets their own
name and their own copy of the @name variable.
 
Try in console (grab the Person class from above).
 
```ruby
class Person
 
  def name=(str)
    @name = str
  end
 
end

puts avi = Person.new
#=> #<Person:0x007fb4dc81add8>
avi.name = "Avi Flombaum"
puts avi
#=> #<Person:0x007fb4dc81add8 @name="Avi Flombaum">
```

Notice how ruby outputs the person instance,
referenced by the local variable avi.
It looks like a standard object.
 
We call the name= method passing in the name,
and then reputs the object.
 
Notice that in the object outputs the Person
instance, represented with the weird #<Object>
syntax, actually has a property within it
@name.
 
But try to read that property, try to get
the name out.
 
```ruby
class Person
 
  def name=(str)
    @name = str
  end
 
end
 
avi.name
#=> NoMethodError: undefined method `name' for #<Person:0x007fb4dc81add8 @name="Avi Flombaum">
```

We have to build a method that will make the value
of @name accessible to the rest of our code,
to the public, so to speak.
 
Let's define a reader for @name
 

```ruby
class Person
 
  def name=(str)
    @name = str
  end
 
  def name
    @name
  end
 
end
```

Why can't we just read the
value from @name? We want our variables to belong
to only the object, not the rest of our code.
 
There are a few reasons, most of them have to do
with encapsulation and SOLID Object Design
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(object-oriented_design)
 
Take the following for example.
http://apidock.com/ruby/Object/instance_variable_get

```ruby
avi.instance_variable_get(:@name)
#=> "Avi Flombaum"
avi.name
#=> "Avi Flombaum"
```

/ Syntactic Vinegar /
I believe that instance_variable_get is an
unruby-esque method name in that in contains
a verb and additionally puts the verb
dangling at the end, if anything, it should
read get_instance_variable. It's weird name
should remind us, DON'T DO THIS.
 
Seems fine, right?
But then we decide that people need a first name
and last name.
 
```ruby
class Person
 
  def first_name=(str)
    @first_name = str
  end
 
  def last_name=(str)
    @last_name = str
  end
 
  def name
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
 
end
```
 
Because we depended on a literal or concrete
variable, our code is broken
 
```ruby
avi = Person.new
avi.first_name, avi.last_name = "Avi", "Flombaum"
 
avi.name #=> "Avi Flombaum"
avi.instance_variable_get(:@name) #=> nil
```

The method, name, is an abstraction of a value
whereas the instance variable @name is a literal
value. The literal value reference, the variable
@name, may change as our application grows.
 
But the interface, how our application uses
that value, that can remain constant, a method
called name.
 
So we store an objects data in instance variables
but we reveal those values to our code
via methods. Those methods are called readers and
writers, or setters and getters.
 
They generally come in pairs, but notice that
the name method above is a reader to a composite
value made up of two instance variables. It
also does not have a corresponding writer
name=.
 
We should talk a bit about this notion of a public
interface vs private interface.

Macros: attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor
 
Macros are code that writes code for you.
 
All this manual definition of readers/writers
is annoying given the strong convention
of a reader reading from an instance variable
of the same of the method, and the writer, writing
to that instance variable named after the method,
we have macros in our classes to automatically
define those methods
 
attr_reader will define a reader method.
 
reload (exit/restart) for all your examples.
 
```ruby
class Person
  attr_reader :first_name, :last_name
 
  def name=(str)
    @first_name, @last_name = str.split
  end
end
 
avi = Person.new
avi.name = "Avi Flombaum"
avi.name #=> NoMethodError
avi.first_name #=> "Avi"
avi.last_name #=> "Flombaum"
 
# attr_writer will define a writer
 
class Person
  attr_writer :name
 
  def first_name
    @name.split.first
  end
 
  def last_name
    @name.split.last
  end
end
 
avi.name = "Avi Flombaum"
avi.first_name #=> "Avi"
avi.last_name #=> "Flombaum"
avi.name #=> NoMethodError
 
# Finally, attr_accessor gives you both
 
class Person
  attr_accessor :name
end
 
avi = Person.new
avi.name = "Avi Flomabaum"
avi.name #=> "Avi Flombaum"
 
# Arbitrary Instance Variables
 
# It is possible to have instance variables created
# in sort of weird methods.
 
class Jukebox
 
  def exit
    @power = false
    puts "Goodbye"
  end
 
  def on?
    @power
  end
 
end
```

The exit method is acting like a writer
but it doesn't end with =
and it does more than just write a value.
But that is a fine usage. It'd be correct
to describe @power not as an attribute, but rather
as a state, or a flag, or a switch.
 
Similarly, on? isn't your standard reader.
It reads from a different variable name
and ends in a question mark. Still valid.
